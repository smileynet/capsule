# Test Specification: Model struct with mode routing and two-pane layout

## Context
- Model struct holds current mode (browse/pipeline/summary), focus state, and pane dimensions
- Mode routing dispatches Update messages to the correct sub-model
- Tab toggles focus between left and right panes
- Two-pane layout calculated from terminal width with configurable split ratio
- WindowSizeMsg updates stored dimensions and recalculates layout
- Deliverable: model.go with Init/Update/View, mode enum, focus toggle

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Initial mode | ModeBrowse | Default startup mode |
| Update in ModeBrowse | Delegates to browse sub-model | Mode routing |
| Update in ModePipeline | Delegates to pipeline sub-model | Mode routing |
| Update in ModeSummary | Delegates to summary sub-model | Mode routing |
| Tab key press | Focus toggles left <-> right | Focus management |
| Layout at width=80 | Left=28, Right=50, gap=2 | Standard terminal |
| Layout at width=120 | Left=40, Right=78, gap=2 | Wide terminal |
| Layout at width=40 | Left=28, Right=10, gap=2 | Narrow terminal clamps left |
| WindowSizeMsg(100, 40) | Width=100, Height=40 stored | Dimension update |
| "q" key in ModeBrowse | tea.Quit returned | Quit from browse |
| "q" key in ModePipeline | No quit (pipeline running) | Quit blocked during pipeline |
| Global key in ModeBrowse | Handled | Global keys work in all modes |
| Global key in ModePipeline | Handled | Global keys work in all modes |
| Global key in ModeSummary | Handled | Global keys work in all modes |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Very narrow terminal (width < 30) does not panic
- [ ] Zero-size WindowSizeMsg (width=0, height=0) handled gracefully
- [ ] Mode transition preserves focus state where appropriate
- [ ] Rapid Tab presses do not corrupt focus state
