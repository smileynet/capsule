# TDD Spec: Create worklog.md template with bead interpolation

**Task:** t-1.2.1
**Feature:** Worktree creation and worklog instantiation
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Shell-based Pipeline Prototype

## Context

Create a worklog template with placeholders: {{EPIC_ID}}, {{EPIC_TITLE}}, {{EPIC_GOAL}}, {{FEATURE_ID}}, {{FEATURE_TITLE}}, {{TASK_ID}}, {{TASK_TITLE}}, {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}, {{ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA}}. Structure includes Mission Briefing section and phase entry sections. The worklog is instantiated per-bead and lives in the worktree as the persistent record of pipeline progress.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Render template with complete sample data via sed/envsubst | All placeholders replaced with sample values | No leftover {{...}} tokens |
| 2 | Check template contains Mission Briefing section | Section header and bead context fields present | Provides Claude with task context |
| 3 | Check template contains phase entry sections | Sections for test-writer, test-review, execute, execute-review, sign-off | All pipeline phases represented |
| 4 | Render template with minimal data (only required fields) | Template renders without errors | Graceful handling of optional fields |
| 5 | Grep rendered output for any remaining {{ or }} | Zero matches | Confirms complete interpolation |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Placeholder values containing special characters (quotes, ampersands) do not break rendering
- [ ] Template uses consistent placeholder naming convention throughout
- [ ] Multi-line acceptance criteria render correctly within the template
- [ ] Template file itself is valid markdown when placeholders are filled

## Deliverable

templates/worklog.md.template
