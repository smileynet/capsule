# Test Specification: Add bead header to pipeline and campaign views

## Bead: cap-fj8.4.1

## Tracer
Context preservation — proves user always knows what's running.

## Context
- Extend pipelineState with optional beadID + title
- Render as dim first line in View()
- Pass from model dispatch

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| pipelineState with beadID="cap-xyz", title="Fix bug" | First line: dim "cap-xyz Fix bug" | Header renders |
| pipelineState with empty beadID | No header line, phases start immediately | Backward compat |
| Pipeline View() height accounting | Header takes 1 line from available height | Layout correct |
| Model dispatch sets beadID/title | pipelineState receives values | Data flow |
| Campaign View() header | Shows parentTitle (existing) | Verify campaign |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Very long title (truncated to width)
- [ ] beadID set but title empty
- [ ] Header style doesn't clash with phase styles

## Implementation Notes
- pipelineState gains: beadID string, beadTitle string
- In View(): if beadID != "" → prepend dim styled "beadID beadTitle\n"
- model.go handlePipelineDispatch: set beadID/title from dispatched bead
- campaign.go already has parentTitle — just verify rendering
