# TDD Spec: Implement Bubble Tea Model

**Task:** t-3.1.1
**Feature:** Bubble Tea phase status model
**Epic:** Epic 3 - TUI Dashboard

## Context

Implement the Bubble Tea Model struct with PhaseState tracking for each pipeline phase. Includes Init, Update, and View methods following the Elm architecture. Uses teatest for pure function testing of model state transitions without requiring a real terminal.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Init model | All phases in Pending state, no active phase | Initial state |
| 2 | Send PhaseStarted message for TestWriter | TestWriter moves to Running state | State transition |
| 3 | Send PhaseCompleted(PASS) for TestWriter | TestWriter moves to Passed state | Success transition |
| 4 | Send PhaseCompleted(NEEDS_WORK) for TestReview | TestReview moves to NeedsWork, retry counter increments | Retry state |
| 5 | Send PipelineComplete message | Model enters completed state | Terminal state |
| 6 | Send PipelineError message | Model enters error state with error details | Error terminal state |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Receiving PhaseCompleted for a phase that was never started -- handled gracefully
- [ ] Rapid successive messages (e.g., start+complete in same update cycle)
- [ ] Model handles unknown message types without panic
- [ ] PhaseState tracks duration from start to completion

## Deliverable

Bubble Tea model with phase tracking
