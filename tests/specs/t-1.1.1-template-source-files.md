# TDD Spec: Create template project source files and CLAUDE.md

**Task:** t-1.1.1
**Feature:** Reusable template project with bead fixtures
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Shell-based Pipeline Prototype

## Context

Create templates/demo-capsule/ with src/ containing a simple Go module (main.go, go.mod) that has a clear feature gap for the test bead to fill, CLAUDE.md documenting the project structure and conventions, and README.md with project description. The template project serves as the reusable test subject that the pipeline operates on during integration and E2E testing.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Check templates/demo-capsule/ exists | Directory exists with expected structure | Root directory validation |
| 2 | Check templates/demo-capsule/src/go.mod exists | Valid go.mod with module declaration | Must be parseable by Go toolchain |
| 3 | Check templates/demo-capsule/src/main.go exists | Valid Go source file with package main | Must compile without errors |
| 4 | Run `go build ./...` in templates/demo-capsule/src/ | Build succeeds with exit code 0 | Confirms template is buildable |
| 5 | Check templates/demo-capsule/CLAUDE.md exists | File contains project structure documentation | Must describe conventions for Claude Code |
| 6 | Check templates/demo-capsule/README.md exists | File contains project description | Basic project documentation |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] go.mod module path is valid and does not conflict with real modules
- [ ] main.go compiles but has an obvious feature gap (e.g., missing function) that a bead task can fill
- [ ] CLAUDE.md does not reference paths outside the template directory
- [ ] Template files do not contain hardcoded absolute paths

## Deliverable

templates/demo-capsule/ with buildable Go project
