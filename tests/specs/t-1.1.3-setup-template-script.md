# TDD Spec: Create setup-template.sh initialization script

**Task:** t-1.1.3
**Feature:** Reusable template project with bead fixtures
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Shell-based Pipeline Prototype

## Context

Script that sets up a fresh project from the template: creates a temp directory, runs git init, copies template files, runs bd init, runs bd import, runs bd dep add, and creates an initial git commit. Uses fail-fast error handling so any step failure aborts immediately.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Run setup-template.sh with no arguments | Creates project in temp dir, prints path to stdout | Default behavior |
| 2 | Verify git repository initialized | `git log` shows at least one commit | Initial commit must exist |
| 3 | Verify bd state after setup | `bd ready` lists the 2 task beads from fixtures | Beads imported and dependencies wired |
| 4 | Verify template files copied | src/main.go, src/go.mod, CLAUDE.md, README.md present | All template files in place |
| 5 | Run setup-template.sh when bd is not installed | Script fails with non-zero exit code and error message | Fail-fast on missing dependency |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Script is idempotent-safe: running twice does not corrupt state (or explicitly uses fresh temp dir each time)
- [ ] Temp directory is created with restrictive permissions
- [ ] Script cleans up on failure (or documents that caller must clean up)
- [ ] Works when run from any working directory (uses absolute paths internally)

## Deliverable

scripts/setup-template.sh
