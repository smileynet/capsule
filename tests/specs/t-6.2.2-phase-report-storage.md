# Test Specification: PhaseReport storage and right-pane rendering

## Context
- PhaseReport captures result data for each completed pipeline phase
- Reports are stored and keyed by phase index
- The right pane renders the report for the currently selected phase
- Report includes summary, files changed list, and feedback (for failed phases)
- Pending and running phases show distinct placeholder content in the right pane
- Deliverable: PhaseReport struct, storage map, right-pane render logic

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Phase passed with report | Report stored at phase index | Storage on pass |
| Phase failed with report | Report stored at phase index | Storage on fail |
| Select passed phase | Right pane shows summary text | Summary rendering |
| Select phase with files changed | Right pane shows file list | Files changed rendering |
| Select failed phase | Right pane shows feedback message | Feedback rendering |
| Select pending phase | Right pane shows "Waiting..." | Pending placeholder |
| Select running phase | Right pane shows spinner + elapsed time | Running placeholder |
| Phase with summary + files + feedback | All sections rendered in order | Full report rendering |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Phase with no files changed: files section omitted or shows "No files changed"
- [ ] Very long summary text wraps correctly in viewport
- [ ] Phase with empty feedback string: feedback section omitted
- [ ] Overwriting a report for the same phase index replaces previous
- [ ] Elapsed time updates while phase is running (tick-based)
