# TDD Spec: Implement View rendering with lipgloss

**Task:** t-3.1.2
**Feature:** Bubble Tea phase status model
**Epic:** Epic 3 - TUI Dashboard

## Context

Implement the View function with lipgloss styling: phase status symbols (spinner for running, checkmark for pass, X for fail, circle for pending), retry counter display, duration per phase, and a summary footer showing overall pipeline status. Styled using lipgloss for terminal-appropriate colors.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | View with all phases Pending | Each phase shown with pending symbol | Initial display |
| 2 | View with TestWriter Running | TestWriter shown with spinner/running symbol | Active phase indicator |
| 3 | View with TestWriter Passed | TestWriter shown with checkmark symbol | Success indicator |
| 4 | View with TestReview NeedsWork, retry count=2 | Retry counter shows "2/N" | Retry visibility |
| 5 | View with completed pipeline | Summary footer shows success message and total duration | Completion display |
| 6 | View with errored pipeline | Summary footer shows error message with details | Error display |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Very long phase names or error messages -- truncated or wrapped appropriately
- [ ] Terminal with no color support -- symbols degrade gracefully (no ANSI codes)
- [ ] Duration display for phases that complete in sub-second time
- [ ] View output is deterministic for the same model state (testable with string comparison)

## Deliverable

Styled phase display view
