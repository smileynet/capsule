# Test Specification: Error states, loading spinners, and failure rendering

## Context
- Loading spinners shown in left pane during bead fetch and right pane during resolve
- Failed bead load shows error message with "r to retry" hint
- Empty bead list shows a friendly "No ready beads" message
- Failed resolve shows error in right pane but left pane list remains navigable
- bd CLI not installed returns an early, descriptive error before TUI starts
- Deliverable: error state rendering, spinner placement, retry UX

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Beads loading | Left pane shows spinner | Loading spinner placement |
| Bead resolving | Right pane shows spinner | Resolve spinner placement |
| BeadLoadErrorMsg | Left pane shows error + "press r to retry" | Failed load rendering |
| "r" key after load error | Reload triggered, spinner shown | Retry mechanism |
| BeadsLoadedMsg with 0 beads | Left pane shows "No ready beads" | Empty state message |
| ResolveBeadErrorMsg | Right pane shows error, list still navigable | Partial failure |
| Navigate after resolve error | Cursor moves, new resolve triggered | List independence |
| bd not installed | Error returned before tea.Program starts | Early exit |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] bd installed but returns non-zero exit code: error message shown
- [ ] Network timeout during bead list fetch: timeout error rendered
- [ ] Network timeout during resolve: timeout error in right pane only
- [ ] Multiple rapid "r" presses do not stack retry requests
- [ ] Error messages with special characters rendered safely
