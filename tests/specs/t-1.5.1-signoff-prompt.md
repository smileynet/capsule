# TDD Spec: Create sign-off prompt template

**Task:** t-1.5.1
**Feature:** Sign-off and merge prompt pair
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Shell-based Pipeline Prototype

## Context

Create prompts/sign-off.md: instructs Claude to read the worklog, run the full test suite, verify the worktree is commit-ready (no untracked debris, clean state), verify all acceptance criteria are met by examining tests and implementation, update the worklog with sign-off findings, and return PASS or NEEDS_WORK signal.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Check prompt file exists at prompts/sign-off.md | File exists and is non-empty | Basic existence check |
| 2 | Verify prompt contains validation checklist | References test passage, acceptance criteria, clean state | Final quality gate |
| 3 | Verify prompt instructs running full test suite | Contains instruction to run all tests | Not just the new tests |
| 4 | Verify prompt checks acceptance criteria traceability | Contains instruction to verify each criterion is covered | Requirements coverage |
| 5 | Verify prompt checks commit readiness | Contains instruction about clean git state, no temp files | Merge hygiene |
| 6 | Verify prompt instructs signal output | Contains JSON signal contract | Machine-readable result |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Prompt handles case where tests pass but acceptance criteria not fully met
- [ ] Prompt handles leftover debug code or TODO comments
- [ ] Prompt checks that worklog is complete (all prior phases recorded)
- [ ] Prompt handles the case where existing tests in the project regress

## Deliverable

prompts/sign-off.md
