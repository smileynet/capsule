# TDD Spec: Create execute-review prompt template

**Task:** t-1.4.2
**Feature:** Execute and execute-review prompt pair
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Shell-based Pipeline Prototype

## Context

Create prompts/execute-review.md: instructs Claude to read the worklog, run tests to verify GREEN state, review implementation quality, check for scope creep (changes beyond what the tests require), update the worklog with review findings, and return PASS or NEEDS_WORK signal.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Check prompt file exists at prompts/execute-review.md | File exists and is non-empty | Basic existence check |
| 2 | Verify prompt contains quality checklist | References code quality, scope adherence, test passage | Review criteria |
| 3 | Verify prompt instructs running tests | Contains instruction to execute test suite | Must verify GREEN state |
| 4 | Verify prompt checks for scope creep | Contains instruction to compare changes against acceptance criteria | Prevents gold-plating |
| 5 | Verify prompt instructs PASS/NEEDS_WORK decision | Contains both outcomes and decision criteria | Binary for retry logic |
| 6 | Verify prompt instructs signal output | Contains JSON signal contract format | Machine-readable result |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Prompt handles case where tests fail (should NEEDS_WORK, not attempt to fix)
- [ ] Prompt handles case where implementation modifies test files (scope creep)
- [ ] Prompt handles case where implementation adds unnecessary features
- [ ] Prompt reviewer does not modify code (review only)

## Deliverable

prompts/execute-review.md
