# TDD Spec: Set up Kong CLI with version and run commands

**Task:** t-2.1.2
**Feature:** Go project skeleton
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Go CLI Tool

## Context

Set up the Kong CLI framework with a CLI struct containing Version, Run, Abort, and Clean subcommands. Version prints the version string injected via ldflags at build time. Run takes a bead-id positional argument plus optional flags. All commands are stubs initially.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Parse `capsule version` | Version command selected, no error | Subcommand routing |
| 2 | Parse `capsule run abc-123` | Run command selected with bead-id=abc-123 | Positional argument parsing |
| 3 | Parse `capsule run` (missing bead-id) | Parse error about missing required argument | Argument validation |
| 4 | Parse `capsule run abc-123 --max-retries=5` | Run command with bead-id and max-retries flag set | Flag override |
| 5 | Parse `capsule clean` | Clean command selected | Subcommand routing |
| 6 | Version command output with ldflags | Prints injected version string (or "dev" default) | Build-time injection |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Unknown subcommand (e.g., `capsule foo`) produces helpful error
- [ ] Help flag (--help) works for all subcommands
- [ ] Bead-id with hyphens and alphanumeric characters parses correctly
- [ ] Empty string bead-id is rejected

## Deliverable

Kong CLI with command stubs
