# TDD Spec: Define phase registry and StatusUpdate types

**Task:** t-2.5.1
**Feature:** Orchestrator
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Go CLI Tool

## Context

Define PhaseKind enum (TestWriter, TestReview, Execute, ExecuteReview, SignOff, Merge), PhaseDefinition struct with metadata, StatusUpdate struct for progress reporting, and StatusCallback function type. Implement a registry that maps phase kinds to their definitions, including which phases form pairs for the retry loop.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Look up TestWriter phase in registry | PhaseDefinition with correct name and prompt reference | Registry lookup |
| 2 | Look up all 6 phases | All return valid PhaseDefinitions | Complete registry |
| 3 | Query phase pairing: TestWriter paired with TestReview | Correct review phase returned | Pair relationship |
| 4 | Query phase pairing: Execute paired with ExecuteReview | Correct review phase returned | Pair relationship |
| 5 | StatusUpdate contains phase, status, message, timestamp | All fields populated | Progress reporting type |
| 6 | StatusCallback invoked with StatusUpdate | Callback receives correct data | Callback mechanism |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Look up invalid/unknown PhaseKind -- returns error or zero value
- [ ] PhaseDefinition includes max retries or inherits from config
- [ ] SignOff and Merge are not paired (they run sequentially, not in retry loop)
- [ ] StatusUpdate timestamp uses monotonic clock for duration calculation

## Deliverable

Phase registry and status types
