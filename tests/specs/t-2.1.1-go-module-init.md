# TDD Spec: Initialize Go module and directory structure

**Task:** t-2.1.1
**Feature:** Go project skeleton
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Go CLI Tool

## Context

Initialize the Go module with go.mod, create cmd/capsule/main.go as the entry point, and set up the internal package structure: internal/{provider,orchestrator,config,worktree,worklog,tui,prompt}/. Each package gets a placeholder test file. The project must pass `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` from the start.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Run `go build ./...` from project root | Exits 0, no errors | All packages compile |
| 2 | Run `go test ./...` from project root | Exits 0, all placeholder tests pass | Test infrastructure works |
| 3 | Verify cmd/capsule/main.go exists with package main | File exists with main function | Entry point present |
| 4 | Verify go.mod has valid module path | Module path matches project convention | e.g., github.com/smileynet/capsule |
| 5 | Verify all internal packages exist | Each directory has at least one .go file | No empty packages (Go requires files) |
| 6 | Verify internal package structure | provider, orchestrator, config, worktree, worklog, tui, prompt directories exist | All planned packages present |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] go.sum is committed (or .gitignore is configured appropriately)
- [ ] Placeholder tests use proper test function naming (Test prefix)
- [ ] No circular import dependencies between internal packages
- [ ] main.go does not import all internal packages directly (avoids coupling)

## Deliverable

go build ./... and go test ./... pass
