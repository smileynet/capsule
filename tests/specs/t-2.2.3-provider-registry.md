# TDD Spec: Add provider registry with factory pattern

**Task:** t-2.2.3
**Feature:** Provider interface
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Go CLI Tool

## Context

Implement a provider registry using the factory pattern: Register(name, factory) to register provider constructors, NewProvider(name) to instantiate a provider by name, and AvailableProviders() to list registered provider names.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Register a provider factory, then NewProvider with that name | Provider instance returned, no error | Happy path |
| 2 | NewProvider with unregistered name | Error indicating unknown provider | Unknown provider handling |
| 3 | AvailableProviders after registering two providers | List contains both names | Enumeration |
| 4 | Register duplicate name | Error or overwrites (document which) | Conflict resolution |
| 5 | NewProvider factory returns error | Error propagated to caller | Factory failure handling |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Registry is safe for concurrent access (or documented as init-time only)
- [ ] Empty registry returns empty list from AvailableProviders
- [ ] Provider names are case-sensitive (or normalized -- document which)
- [ ] Registry does not hold references to created providers (factory creates fresh each time)

## Deliverable

Provider registry
