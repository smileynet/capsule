# Test Specification: Pipeline mode phase list with status indicators

## Context
- Pipeline mode displays a list of pipeline phases in the left pane
- Each phase has a status: pending, running, passed, failed
- Status indicators: dot (pending), spinner (running), checkmark (passed), cross (failed)
- Retry counter displayed as "attempt/max" when retries occur
- Duration shown for each completed phase
- Auto-follow mode tracks the currently running phase; cursor movement disables it
- Deliverable: pipeline.go phase list rendering, auto-follow logic

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Phase status=pending | Dot indicator rendered | Pending indicator |
| Phase status=running | Spinner indicator rendered | Running indicator |
| Phase status=passed | Green checkmark rendered | Passed indicator |
| Phase status=failed | Red cross rendered | Failed indicator |
| Phase with retry=2, max=3 | "2/3" shown next to phase name | Retry counter |
| Completed phase with duration=12s | "12s" shown next to phase | Duration display |
| Auto-follow enabled, running phase=3 | Cursor at index 3 | Auto-follow tracks running |
| Down key press | Auto-follow disabled, cursor moves | Manual override |
| New PhaseStartedMsg while auto-follow | Cursor jumps to new running phase | Auto-follow in action |
| Up key press | Auto-follow disabled, cursor moves up | Manual override |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] All phases pending: no auto-follow target, cursor at 0
- [ ] Single phase pipeline: cursor stays at 0 regardless
- [ ] Rapid phase transitions update indicators without flicker
- [ ] Duration formatting: seconds, minutes, hours handled
- [ ] Phase name truncation for narrow left pane
