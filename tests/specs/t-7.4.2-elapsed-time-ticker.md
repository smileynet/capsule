# Test Specification: Add elapsed time ticker to running phases

## Bead: cap-fj8.4.2

## Tracer
Responsiveness — proves real-time feedback works.

## Context
- Track phase start time in pipelineState
- Show elapsed seconds next to running phase
- Use 1-second tea.Tick for updates

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Phase transitions to Running | phaseStartedAt set to now | Timestamp captured |
| View() with running phase at 42s elapsed | Shows "(42s)" next to phase name | Elapsed display |
| Phase transitions to Passed | phaseStartedAt cleared | Stop counting |
| TickMsg while pipeline running | View re-renders with updated time | Live update |
| No running phase | No elapsed display | Clean state |
| Model enters ModePipeline | Starts 1s tea.Tick | Tick lifecycle |
| Model leaves ModePipeline | Stops tea.Tick | Tick cleanup |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Phase completes in < 1 second (show "(<1s)" or just duration)
- [ ] Multiple rapid phase transitions
- [ ] Tick arrives after pipeline complete (ignore)
- [ ] Elapsed time display with very long durations (>60s → "1m 5s"?)

## Implementation Notes
- pipelineState gains: phaseStartedAt time.Time
- On PhaseRunning: set phaseStartedAt = time.Now()
- On PhasePassed/PhaseFailed/PhaseError: clear phaseStartedAt
- In View(): if running && phaseStartedAt.IsZero() == false → show elapsed
- Model manages tea.Tick(time.Second) subscription
