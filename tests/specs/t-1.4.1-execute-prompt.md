# TDD Spec: Create execute prompt template

**Task:** t-1.4.1
**Feature:** Execute and execute-review prompt pair
**Epic:** Epic 1 - Shell-based Pipeline Prototype

## Context

Create prompts/execute.md: instructs Claude to read the worklog and test entries, confirm tests are in RED state (failing), implement the minimum code to make tests GREEN, optionally refactor, update the worklog with implementation details, and output the JSON signal.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Check prompt file exists at prompts/execute.md | File exists and is non-empty | Basic existence check |
| 2 | Verify prompt instructs reading worklog and tests | Contains instruction to read worklog.md and test files | Context from prior phases |
| 3 | Verify prompt instructs confirming RED state | Contains instruction to run tests and verify they fail | TDD gate: must be RED before implementing |
| 4 | Verify prompt instructs GREEN implementation | Contains instruction to implement minimum passing code | TDD discipline: minimal implementation |
| 5 | Verify prompt instructs worklog update | Contains instruction to append execute phase entry | Audit trail |
| 6 | Verify prompt instructs signal output | Contains JSON signal contract | Machine-readable result |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Prompt handles case where tests already pass (should signal ERROR, not implement)
- [ ] Prompt instructs not to modify test files during execute phase
- [ ] Prompt instructs refactoring only after GREEN is achieved
- [ ] Prompt handles multiple test files requiring coordinated implementation

## Deliverable

prompts/execute.md
