# Test Specification: Create archive reader for pipeline results

## Bead: cap-fj8.2.2

## Tracer
Data layer — proves we can read archived worklog and summary files.

## Context
- New file internal/dashboard/archive.go
- Reads from .capsule/logs/<beadID>/ directory

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| ReadWorklog("bead-1") with file exists | Returns worklog content | Happy path |
| ReadWorklog("bead-1") with no file | Returns os.ErrNotExist | Missing file |
| ReadSummary("bead-1") with file exists | Returns summary content | Happy path |
| ReadSummary("bead-1") with no file | Returns os.ErrNotExist | Missing file |
| ReadWorklog("bead-1") with empty file | Returns empty string, nil | Empty is valid |
| ReadSummary with custom baseDir | Reads from custom path | Configurable base |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Bead ID with special characters (slashes, dots)
- [ ] Very large worklog file (performance)
- [ ] Permission denied on file read
- [ ] Base directory doesn't exist

## Implementation Notes
- ArchiveReader interface for testability
- FileArchiveReader struct with baseDir field
- Paths: baseDir/<beadID>/worklog.md, baseDir/<beadID>/summary.md
- Use os.ReadFile, wrap with %w for errors
