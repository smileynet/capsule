# Test Specification: Browse mode with async bead loading and cursor navigation

## Context
- Browse mode displays a hand-rolled list of ready beads in the left pane
- Beads are loaded asynchronously via a BeadLister interface
- Cursor navigation with up/down keys, selection with Enter
- Refresh with "r" key triggers reload
- Loading, error, and empty states each have distinct rendering
- Deliverable: browse.go with bead list, cursor, async loading

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Init (beads loading) | Spinner visible, no list items | Loading state |
| BeadsLoadedMsg with 5 beads | 5 items rendered in list | Successful load |
| Down key (cursor at 0) | Cursor moves to 1 | Basic navigation |
| Up key (cursor at 2) | Cursor moves to 1 | Basic navigation |
| Down key at last item | Cursor stays at last item | No wrap past end |
| Up key at first item | Cursor stays at 0 | No wrap past start |
| Enter key (cursor at 2) | BeadSelectedMsg with bead[2] dispatched | Selection dispatch |
| "r" key press | BeadsLoadingMsg dispatched, spinner shown | Refresh trigger |
| BeadLoadErrorMsg | Error message rendered, list hidden | Error state |
| BeadsLoadedMsg with 0 beads | "No ready beads" message shown | Empty state |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Single bead in list: cursor cannot move, Enter selects it
- [ ] Rapid cursor movement does not skip items or go out of bounds
- [ ] Refresh during loading state does not duplicate requests
- [ ] Bead list preserves cursor position after refresh if same beads returned
- [ ] Very long bead titles are truncated to fit pane width
