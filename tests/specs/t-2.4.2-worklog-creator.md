# TDD Spec: Implement worklog Creator and Archiver

**Task:** t-2.4.2
**Feature:** Worktree and worklog lifecycle
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Go CLI Tool

## Context

Implement worklog lifecycle operations: Create instantiates a worklog from the template with bead context, AppendPhaseEntry adds a timestamped phase result entry, and Archive moves the completed worklog to the archive directory with bead-id-based naming.

## Test Cases

| # | Input / Setup | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Create worklog with mock bead context | worklog.md created with interpolated bead data | Template instantiation |
| 2 | AppendPhaseEntry to existing worklog | New entry appended with timestamp, phase name, result | Append semantics |
| 3 | AppendPhaseEntry multiple times | Entries appear in chronological order | Ordering preserved |
| 4 | Archive worklog to target directory | File moved, target file named with bead-id | Archive naming convention |
| 5 | Archive when target directory does not exist | Directory created, then archive succeeds | Auto-create archive dir |
| 6 | Create worklog when file already exists | Error or overwrite (document which) | Idempotency decision |

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Bead context with multi-line description -- renders correctly in worklog
- [ ] AppendPhaseEntry on non-existent worklog -- error with clear message
- [ ] Archive source file does not exist -- error with clear message
- [ ] Concurrent AppendPhaseEntry calls -- file locking or documented as single-threaded only

## Deliverable

Worklog create/append/archive
