# Test Specification: Add Closed() method to bead client

## Bead: cap-fj8.2.1

## Tracer
Data layer — proves we can fetch closed beads from bd CLI.

## Context
- Extend internal/bead/bead.go with Closed() method
- Parses bd list --status=closed --json output

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Closed(10) with 5 closed beads | Returns 5 Summary items | Under limit |
| Closed(3) with 10 closed beads | Returns 3 Summary items | Limit respected |
| Closed(0) | Returns empty slice | Zero limit |
| Closed(50) with no closed beads | Returns empty slice | No results |
| Closed(10) with bd error | Returns error | Error propagation |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Closed beads with missing fields in JSON output
- [ ] Very large number of closed beads (performance)
- [ ] Closed bead with no type field

## Implementation Notes
- Mirror Ready() implementation pattern
- Command: bd list --status=closed --json --limit=N
- Parse into []Summary (same struct as Ready)
