# Test Specification: Kong DashboardCmd wiring and adapter types

## Context
- DashboardCmd is a Kong command struct registered under "capsule dashboard"
- Follows Run()/run() split: Run() constructs real dependencies, run() accepts interfaces for testing
- Adapter types bridge bead.Client methods to dashboard's BeadLister/BeadResolver interfaces
- Non-TTY detection returns an early error
- Deliverable: cmd/capsule DashboardCmd, adapter types, run() testable entrypoint

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| "capsule dashboard" | Parses to DashboardCmd | Kong parse test |
| Non-TTY stdin | Returns descriptive error | TTY guard |
| run() with mock BeadLister | Program created and started | Testable wiring |
| run() with mock BeadResolver | Program created and started | Testable wiring |
| beadListerAdapter.List() | Converts bead.Client output to []DashboardBead | Adapter conversion |
| beadResolverAdapter.Resolve(id) | Converts bead.Client output to BeadDetail | Adapter conversion |
| beadListerAdapter with error | Error propagated from bead.Client | Error passthrough |
| beadResolverAdapter with error | Error propagated from bead.Client | Error passthrough |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] bd CLI not found on PATH returns clear error message
- [ ] Missing optional flags use sensible defaults
- [ ] Adapter handles nil/empty results from bead.Client without panic
- [ ] run() cancellation (context cancel) propagates to tea.Program
