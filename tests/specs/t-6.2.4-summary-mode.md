# Test Specification: Summary mode with any-key return and cache invalidation

## Context
- Summary mode is entered when the pipeline completes (channel closed)
- Displays overall result: pass (green checkmark + phase count + total duration) or fail (red cross + error)
- Any key press transitions back to browse mode
- On return to browse, the bead detail cache is invalidated and bead list is refreshed
- Left pane shows frozen phase list from the completed pipeline
- Deliverable: summary.go with result rendering, transition logic, cache invalidation

## Test Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Pipeline passed (5 phases, 45s) | Green checkmark + "5/5 passed" + "45s" | Pass rendering |
| Pipeline failed at phase 3 | Red cross + error message | Fail rendering |
| Any key press (e.g., Enter) | Transition to ModeBrowse | Any-key return |
| Any key press (e.g., Space) | Transition to ModeBrowse | Any-key return |
| Return to browse | cache.Invalidate() called | Cache invalidation |
| Return to browse | BeadLister.List() re-triggered | Bead list refresh |
| Left pane in summary | Frozen phase list (non-interactive) | Frozen left pane |
| Pipeline result with duration | Formatted duration string shown | Duration display |

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Pipeline with zero phases completed (immediate failure): shows error, no phase stats
- [ ] Error message very long: truncated or wrapped to fit
- [ ] Key press during transition animation does not double-trigger
- [ ] Frozen phase list retains last known phase statuses accurately
