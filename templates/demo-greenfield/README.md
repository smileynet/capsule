# Demo Greenfield

A greenfield template used as a test subject for the capsule pipeline.

## Overview

This template contains no source code. The pipeline creates everything from scratch based on the AGENTS.md conventions and task descriptions. It defines a vanilla JS todo app that agents build entirely during pipeline execution.

## Purpose

This template is used by `setup-template.sh --template=demo-greenfield` to create a fresh, deterministic starting state for capsule pipeline test runs. The bead fixtures define tasks to implement a complete todo web application from nothing.
